    //this is at least something, might be faster than recording node paths in the real algo...
    //jk there is definitely a smarter way to record the list in the real pathfind, but where would it be worked in???
    //aghhhhh maybe if i can delete some shite and try that...
    //ALL THE NODES
    //course maybe it doesn't work that way....like it reads a graph map, spreads out and stuff, etc.
