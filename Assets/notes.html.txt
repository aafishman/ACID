Basic place to hold notes.

Initial commit on 8/15/2020

Based off a package that I eventually got to work after importing their settings and stuff to 
    - astar pathfinding
    - somewhat random single color tilemap generator
    - start point and end point randomly generated, a path is displayed
    - over and over


Ok so not it is modified to at least have another sprite from start move along the path in ticks 
    - just teleport by moving along the path nodes after waitfor in the coroutine
    - changed it from instantiating a new coroutien at the end of each one to making it a while loop so it doesn't use more mem each tile
    - does make it harder to trigger new map when the new sprite gets to the end of the path - but do I want that anyways?

Next Steps:
    - more sprites on their own paths?
    - make something that doesn't move it, but generates new path from its current location
        - that will make it like a wander..
    - make time advance or whatever only after a space bar press or input or something
        - issue: how much do things move or whatever? Is it based on how many nodes away things are and some rounding? 
        - so like someone can go 1,2,3 spaces, like that?
        - i guess could litteraly just have that coroutien that moves the sprite just adanvce with space bar
        - and it will advance as much as it has a speed stat? something like that?


        - see notes in level builder for having decided how to do things
        -BIG problem tho - need to be able to make the pathfinder NOT do diagonals...
            - hrm...

                -answer is in there combined with changing somethign either in the AStar.cs file or maybe the graph .cs thing that it also uses or something else...
                //OH HELL YEAH IT HAD SOME STUFF BUILT IN FOR THAT ALREADY
                -- SET TO NO DIAGONAL FOR NOW
                -- TO CHANGE BACK, in ASTAR.CS, CHANGE FourDirectionGraph back to Movegraph. See Graph.cs to see a lil description - actually does show that Fourdirection is what I want
                    -- and Movegraph includes diagonals
                    -- can i pass in multiple things of things etc to be able to populate with both if i want? maybe?
